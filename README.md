# SQL_University
The goal of the task was to prepare a design of a management system for a university, that
would manage courses, students and academic teachers. Following that, I proposed a set
of appropriate indexes improving the speed of retrieving data from a database, performed
examples of rows modification for a selected tables, prepared SELECT queries and a stored
procedure.
